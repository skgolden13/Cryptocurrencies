# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview

This project utilizes unsupervised machine learning to analyze tradable cryptocurrencies and classify them into groups based on their features. K-Means was used to cluster the currencies, 3D and 2D scatter plots were used for visualization of the clusters, and a sortable table was created using hvplot for all currencies analyzed.
